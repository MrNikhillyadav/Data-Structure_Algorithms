### [3. Longest Subarray With Sum K](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/longest-subarray-with-sum-k_6682399)
**Difficulty: Medium**



<hr>

Note for me :
1. There are 3 approaches to this problem.(Brute-force, better, optimal)
2. Better & optimal approach depends on given array.
3. Case : 1 - for positives & negatives array elements, using Hashing is the Optimal Approach.
4. Case : 2 - for positives & zeroes, Double-pointer is the optimal approach and hasing would then be the better approach.
