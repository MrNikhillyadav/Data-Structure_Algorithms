This repository is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C++ and includes solutions to LeetCode problems, along with notes on problem-solving approaches.


## Introduction

__Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository!__ Here, I've compiled a library of common data structures, algorithms, and LeetCode problem solutions using C++. This repository serves as a resource for studying and practicing data structures and algorithm concepts.

## Data Structures

- [1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated](./1752.-Check-if-Array-Is-Sorted-and-Rotated)
- [1.Second Largest Element in an Array](./https://github.com/MrNikhillyadav/Data-Structure_Algorithms/tree/main) </br>

Each data structure implementation is well-documented and includes important functions and methods.

## Algorithms

- [Sorting Algorithms](./algorithms/sorting.cpp)
- [Searching Algorithms](./algorithms/searching.cpp)


The algorithms are explained with comments and include examples of how to use them.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you'd like to contribute a new data structure, algorithm, or LeetCode solution, please follow these guidelines:
- Create a new branch for your contribution.
- Document your code and provide a brief explanation.
- Ensure your code is well-tested.
- Make a pull request, and I'll review your contribution.

__Happy coding and enjoy your journey into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms!__
